    <dev><p>I enjoy going to see live music and try to go to as many gigs as I can, as well as a festival or two a year. This was the main thing that I could not wait for after the pandemic, as it is my favourite thing to do. Below are some examples of pictures I have taken, I'm not a professional photographer, and only take a few on my phone for memories.</p></dev>

    <dev><p>I also enjoy playing video games, I have been playing video games for the majority of my life. When I was younger, I first started playing on the Sega Mega Drive when I was very young, as this was bought just after I was born. From there I remember getting a Game Boy Colour as the first console that was mine, and I used to play that a lot. I would also play PC games on the family computer, but there was a lot less games that I would play on here, as we didn't really have it for gaming. Currently I have a PlayStation 5 and play several games on there, with my current favourite games being the SoulsBorne series.</p></dev>

        <dev><p>On top of these I also like to go to the gym a couple of times a week, as I like to try and keep active, and I also walk my dog which also keeps me active. I enjoy watching films, with Star Wars and the Marvel films being my favourites.</p></dev>
