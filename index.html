    <div class="image_left"><div><p>Most recently I have taken a coding course with Code Nation, who have shown me how to use a program called 'Visual Studio Code' to use coding. The coding languages that I used their were python, which I used to create a text based adventure game, and <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> that I used to create this website.</p></div><div><img src="/images/codenationlogo.png" alt="Code Nation logo"></div></div><br>
    <div class="image_right"><div><p>I worked for Proximo Legal services for two years from February 2019 until April 2021. This is a solicitors who deal mostly with personal injury claims. Here I was an admin assistant where I was in charge of opening the post every morning, scanning on each bit of post and allocating it to the correct file. With this I would do it so that I put the cheques on first and updated a spreadsheet for the accounts team, so they knew how much money was coming in. As well as this I also answered phone calls, both internal and external, and putting them through to the correct person needed</p></div><div><img src="/images/proximologo.png" alt="Proximo logo"></div></div>
    <div class="image_left"><div><p>I previously worked for Matrix Solicitors, from April 2016 until July 2018. This is a solicitors who deal with personal injury, as well as housing disrepair. I was an admin assistant here as well with similar duties such as collecting the post in the morning, and scanning it all onto the system, allocating it to the right file. I also collected the post from everyone, enveloped it all, and franked it. When taking the post to the post office in the afternoon I was also given the cheques of that day to put into the bank.</p></div><div><img src="/images/matrixlogo.png" width=300 hight=150 alt="Matrix logo"></div></div>
